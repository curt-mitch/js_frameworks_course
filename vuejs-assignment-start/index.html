<!--
  1) Create a <div> and take control with a Vue Instance
  2) Output an array of hobbies in this <div> (provide some default hobbies)
  3) Add a 'New Hobby' button + <input> field where you add the hobby the user entered to the list
  4) Make the hobbies clickable to remove them once clicked
  5) Add a <p>Hobby deleted!</p> which is only shown once at least one hobby was deleted (be creative on how to track this!)
  6) Add a hobby counter (<p>Hobbies: ...</p>) above the list of hobbies
  7) Dynamically style/ add classes to the hobby counter, depending on whether you have more or less than 3 hobbies
  8) Outsource your hobbies (the <li> elements) into a re-usable component
